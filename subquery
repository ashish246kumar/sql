Write a query to find the sums of the amounts from the orders table, grouped by date, and eliminate all dates where the sum was not at least 1000.00 above the maximum order amount for that date.

SELECT order_date, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date
HAVING SUM(amount) > (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM orders o WHERE o.order_date = orders.order_date) + 1000.00;
